This is an implementation of the game Dots and Boxes.
This is my Final Year Project implementation.

To play the game, launch 'GameHandler.py'

Currently, this is only a simple version of the game with an ASCII representation.

'Moves' are made as a 3-tuple of ints. The way that lines are indexed and accessed is described
in 'index.png'.
This file also describes the way boxes are indexed, although this is not visible to the player.

When playing the game, enter 'r' to play a random legal move.
